Hellooo, mariaigle98 over here.

This is a practice project from the great midudev. 

Pasting the link over here in case you want to check his awesome React tutorial on this project:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkzcjwnueLA&t=4046s

The components and most of the logic were created following his tutorial. 

After that I changed a little bit the UI to give it a more neon-retro look.

Also added logic to let us play against the machine.

I'm only starting my journey with React apps, so any comments or improvements are welcome.

Aaaaand, give it a try! See if you can beat the machine ðŸ˜ˆ
